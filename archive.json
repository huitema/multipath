I think we might also want to add a sentence in the Sec. of \"one packet number space\" explicitly specifying that \"for single PN, use ACK instead of ACK_MP\", and change some texts in the ACK_MP frame section that is related to zero-length CID (the current draft says \"if the endpoint receives 1-RTT packets with 0-length Connection ID, it SHOULD use Packet Number Space Identifier 0 in ACK_MP frames\". ).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Do we really need to send \"abandon path\" in both directions?

How does the server know whether it should create a new path or not?\r\n\r\nI think in single PN, sending \"abandon path\" in both directions is helpful. When the client sends \"PATH_ABANDON\", it promises not to send non-probing packets in the current activity cycle. It could send probing packets to reactivate the path a moment later if the client thinks the network environment has changed. After sending out \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client should still be able to receive packets from the server for a while on that path because there may be the server's inflight packets on that path. It was not until the client sees the server's \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client then knows that no more server's data is to be expected except for some out-of-order packets. So after receiving \"PATH_ABANDON\", the endpoint can start preparing to free memories and clear path stats allocated for that path. The time interval from seeing \"PATH_ABANDON\" to actually releasing relevant resources is going to be an important parameter, and yes, 10-30 seconds is too long. What would be a more appropriate number for this interval? \r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the single space case, the logical test may be to check the sequence numbers of the packet. If the sequence number of the new packet is greater than that of the path_abandon, then the client is reactivating a path that was abandoned previously. Maybe the client connected again to the same network, after some disconnected interval. The server can start sending on the reactivated path. If the packet number is lower than that of the path abandon, then the server should not reactivate the path.\r\n\r\nDoes it imply that we need to track the packet number of the PATH_ABANDON for a path that is closed? When a path is in a closed state, the server may reject any newly received packets unless it is a probing packet (back to our path initialization process). In this way, it should be OK to forget any info related to that path in the last activity cycle.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the multiple space case, if the CID is defined, there is no ambiguity.\r\n\r\n",

As the problem is similar to FIN-ACK&FIN-ACK when TCP closes, I kept the ACK in the graph (because the path_id_type=2 refers to the path where the packet is traveling, we want to make sure it is acked before we close the path.). Regarding the resource, I think if we keep a unified receive record, which is not per-path, yes, we can discard the sending resources. But if we have some path stats (e.g. how many packets received in total in this current activity cycle), we need to keep these data structures until we are sure that the peer is not going to send more packets on that path. Indeed, it depends on the implementation, but I feel it is generally helpful to have PATH_ABANDON sent in both directions.

This is basically the same issue as determining whether a connection is broken, just applied to a path. But that is not entirely sufficient, because the server needs to also infer whether the client still wants to use that path.\r\n\r\nThe monitoring of non probing packets is just an heuristic. The server observes that if the client is not using the path, and deduces that it should not be using it itself. That's not a bad heuristic, but it requires the client to send some kinds of \"keep alive\" if it wants the server to continue using a path. We may debate how often that should happen. Maybe reuse the same timeout as for jettisoning paths.\r\n\r\nAnother solution may be for the client to tell something like \"please don't use that path anymore\", but that requires adding a new frame as part of the core multipath specification. In draft-liu, this was done with a specialization of the \"path status\", setting the status to \"Abandon\". Maybe we should just use a simplified for of the PATH_STATUS, leaving out the complexities of managing priorities for the advanced scheduling drafts:\r\n```\r\nABANDON_PATH Frame {\r\n  Type (i) = TBD,\r\n  Path_identifier (i),\r\n  Error Code (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase Length (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase (..),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

However if we think one packet number space is mandatory to implement, it would make more sense to have it the other way around and allow fallback to one packet number space, namely if the client ask for two packet number spaces but the server supports only one but would also lead to a successful negotiation.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think about this?",

          "body": "As long as inter-op is allowed, I think it might be better to keep both PN space choices optional (Mirja's proposal of using enable_multipath=1 or 2 works for me). The first thing is to allow people more freedom. If some implementors only want to use one option, they just need to implement one code branch.  Second, single packet number space requires the modification of loss detection algorithm, the way how rtt is sampled (the overall largest ack may not be the largest acked packet on a given path), and some delayed ACK strategies, which might take additional effort. People may also want to avoid round-robin scheduling in single PN as it creates a lot of holes in the ack range, so certain things regarding performance get coupled. Christian introduced many good practices and we are currently learning from it, so we probably need more experience on that.  ",

To avoid failure for interop tests, I suggest that we could negotiate the transport parameter like this: use 2-bits in the value field for negotiating one or more PN spaces.\r\n\r\n- 0x0: don't support multi-path\r\n- 0x1: only support multiple PN spaces for multi-path\r\n- 0x2: only support one PN space for multi-path\r\n- 0x3: support both one PN space and multiple PN space \r\n\r\nThe client could send all these 4 values in the enable_multipath transport parameter which depends on what kind of modes it supports. If the server just support one mode(such as one PN space), it could return 0x2 so that the client knows how to do next. If the server support both, it could choose 0x1 or 0x2 as it prefers, and make sure that the server don't return 0x3 as it need to decide which mode to choose. In 0x2 mode, the endpoints must not use 0-length CID.\r\n\r\nThen for people who just want one PN space, it would be ok to just support 0x2 mode. For the other guys who don't use 0-length Connection ID and want to get less overhead for ack ranges, they could choose to use 0x1 mode. And for people who want to support both 0-length CID and multiple PN spaces, they could choose 0x3 and of course it will add more modification in the implementation.\r\nMaybe this could meet everyone's need for experiments. \r\n\r\n",

The effect of any design changes on packet encryption/decryption should take HW offloads into account. As I understand it, single packet space would not modify the packet encryption/decryption logic, but the multi packet space design would because of the difference nonce length. Additionally, since multi-path would be a negotiated feature/extension, that would mean all connections that don't negotiate the feature would have the \"old\" model/logic, where as the connections that do would have the new encryption/decryption logic.

In the current draft, we consider that if the connection ID is zero-length, the packet number space identifier is 0, and applying multiple packet number spaces is thus not possible.\r\n\r\nI believe we can do better than this. Consider the situation where the client uses a non-zero length DCID to reach the server while the server uses zero-length DCID. In this case, it is the client that initiates the usage of a path with path validation, associating a server-provided non-zero-length DCID to reach the server. Once the first client's packet reaches the server on the new path, the server can associate the client's 5-tuple to the sequence number of the used Destination Connection ID, making a valid Packet Number Space Identifier. The client can easily map incoming packets on the 5-tuple to the associated DCID sequence number.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound reasonable?",

In such scenarios, migration originating from the server will just fail. If you want to make them work, you have to get a cooperation between client and server. In the case of big cloud servers, the solution is something like the preferred address extension: the server tells the client that it can also be joined at an alternate address, and the client opens a path to that. In the case of peer to peer servers, the solution requires something like ICE. These are valuable things to do, but they should be described in an extension, not in the core document.",

It may also want to keep some context to process acknowledgement of packets previously sent on that path. The general guidance is to to wait for something like 3xRTO before dropping path management resource.\r\n\r\nI don't think that we need symmetry, that both peers have to abandon the path before they can release resource. But we have to solve a potential path suicide problem. Suppose we have two paths, peer 1 abandons path #1, peer 2 abandon path #2. Now we have zero path, and the connection is closed -- unless the client promptly opens a new path #3. My original intention is that only the client ever sends an ABANDON_PATH, since only the client can initiate a new path, which dodges the path suicide issue. ",

For me, the issue is that when an endpoint decides to close a path, it is probably due to that the path condition is getting worse, which also means that further communication on that path may fail. When we use non-zero CID, as we should have at least one path that is working (if no path is working, the connection will be closed), and we are not constraint to send PATH_ABANDON frame on the same path that we want to close, the sender should be able to receive the ACK of PATH_ABANDON. But when we use null CID, we use path_id_type 0x02, which refers to the path where the packet is coming from, and hence, we are constraint to send PATH_ABANDON on the same path we want to close. In such a case, it is likely that the ACK of PATH_ABANDON will not be received, resulting in the \"half-open\" problem. Therefore, we should say sth like \"when the sender moves into the \"ABANDON_SENT\" state, and after 3RTO, it should close the path even if it hasn't seen the PATH_ABANDON sent from its peer\". \r\n",

The receiver-side resources are released when the RETIRE_CID frame is received.

Or, we see what Ali Baba has done for video download, using redundant transmission on multiple paths to minimize buffering of videos. That's very interesting, but is very different from simply scheduling streams on specific paths. \r\n\r\nWe are barely scratching the surface of what can be possible.

This definition works well for MPTCP where each data packet triggers an ACK on the same path. In MPQUIC, a server could have two paths that it uses to send data. However, the client might decide to always send the ACKs on only one path (e.g. the lowest delay one). In this case, the two paths are clearly active, but the server could consider the higher delay path to be inactive since it does not receive packets over this path. It could send PING frames to trigger data packets, but then it would need to send one PING every 3 RTT, which seams excessive. \r\n\r\nI would suggest to rewrite the text as follows (I removed Server, because I think the recommendation should be generic):\r\n\r\n     When more than one path is available, hosts shall monitor both the arrival of non-probing packets and the acknowledgements \r\n     for the packets sent over each path.

There are two transport parameters that could warrant some discussion:\r\n\r\n- disable_active_migration : This transport parameter is incompatible with enable_multipath. An endpoint that receives both this transport parameter and a non zero enable_multipath parameter MUST treat this as a connection error of type\r\nMP_CONNECTION_ERROR and close the connection.\r\n- preferred_address: RFC9000, section 9.2.1 contains the following:\r\n\r\n   Once the handshake is confirmed, the client SHOULD select one of the two addresses provided by the server and initiate path    \r\n  validation (see Section 8.2). A client constructs packets using any previously unused active connection ID, taken from either the \r\n  preferred_address transport parameter or a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.\r\n\r\n  As soon as path validation succeeds, the client SHOULD begin sending all future packets to the new server address using the \r\n  new connection ID and discontinue use of the old server address. If path validation fails, the client MUST continue sending all \r\n  future packets to the server's original IP address.\r\n\r\nFor multipath, do we want to be stronger than SHOULD select one ? Can a client create news paths towards the initial address or only to one of the preferred addresses ? Should the client use both addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) if non-empty ?",

Multi-path protocols like [MPTCP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8684.html#section-2.5) and [MP-DCCP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-multipath-dccp-02#section-3.2.10), see this in scope and define therefore a `MP_PRIO` option.\r\n**So far, MP-QUIC does not define anything in this direction.**\r\nBeyond path scheduling MP-QUIC also offers stream multiplexing, where it can be useful to have a prioritization indication for stream schedulers at both ends. Per https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-2.3, stream prioritization is so far not not part of QUIC v1.\r\n\r\n### Request\r\n**Define a prioritization exchange for paths and streams within the MP-QUIC draft.** \r\n\r\n### Benefit\r\nThis facilitates scenarios where both sides should apply the same path/stream prioritization (e.g. trigger a handover or respect cost) or the information about the sender prioritization is useful for e.g. re-ordering mechanisms on receiver side.

How can the server know which encryption context it should use? The same issue would also happen in the case of NAT rebinding. The server sees a new five tuple, does not know what encryption to apply.\r\n\r\nSo, the first request is to specialize this text to the case in which the client uses zero length CID but the server does not.\r\n\r\nEven in that case, using the five tuple is going to make client-side encryption offload significantly more complex. The offload engines will have to remember all the five tuples used in the connection, and the corresponding keys.

On the specific, the changes are a mix of suggested rewrite for clarity and subtle deviations from the original intent. The clarity part is a matter of taste; the subtle deviations need discussion.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, to process. Since the DPRIVE WG has not adopted a fully GitHub based process, the preferred method for requesting changes is by having a discussion on the WG mailing list. If we did adopt a GitHub based process, we should probably first migrate this depot to an IETF managed account. Then, we should make clear that discussions should start by opening an issue, not a pull request. Issues allow presentation of the problem before text changes and the archival of those discussions, pull requests are not designed for that. They should come later, when the issue has outlined a consensus for change.",

We have two cases.\r\n\r\n1. 1 sent on B, 2 sent on A\r\n\r\nThere are two sub-cases here.\r\n\r\n- The receiver sends an ACK before having received 2. `ACK(largest=1)` contains the ACK delay relative to path B. Then it receives 2, and sends `ACK(largest=2)` with ACK delay relative to path A. In this case, we have ACK delay for both paths.\r\n\r\n- The receiver waited for 2 before sending its ACK. Then, the ACK delay of `ACK(largest=2)` relates to path A, and we don't have the host delay of path B.\r\n\r\n2. 1 sent on A, 2 sent on B\r\n\r\nWhile we still have the two sub-cases, they both lead to the same result: `ACK(largest=2, missing=1)` and `ACK(largest=2)` have their ACK delay relative to the host delay of path B and not to the path A.\r\n\r\nIn general, if the largest packet number has been sent on the lowest latency path, it will prevent the receiver from advertising the host delay of higher latency paths. Note that the \"ideal case\" (where both paths have estimates) only works if the sender does not transmit further packets on the fast path, in which case we fall into case 2. As the fast path will get its packets acknowledged quicker, the sender will likely send further packets on fast path first. It might still be possible to get host delay estimates of slower paths, but most of the ACK delays will relate to the fast one.",
